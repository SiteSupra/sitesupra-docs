Templates
---------

Templates control how your website appears. SiteSupra template provides a method of integration between content and blocks in a specific, controlled view. Site is created by first placing one or more blocks on a template and then creating pages based on those templates.  While each template can be configured separately, when adding new pages and selecting template, page will consist of template's specified design, layout and blocks within placeholders, so you can significantly save the time by creating new pages and content.  

While in a Sitemap view, you can switch to Templates editing mode:

"**img**"

If you want to create a page with unique set of blocks to implement original page design, you would need to create a separate page template first so that other pages are not affected. Creating page template is easy, you can just duplicate a page template you like. 

For example, website consists of three simple pages: Home, Services and Contacts.

"**img**"

Which in templates will look like this:

"**img**"

Where pages are built on basis of:
* Page Home is created from template Home, where Home page content is inherit Header/Footer and Home template content.
* Page Services is created from template Inner, where Services page content is inherit from Header/Footer and * Inner templates.
* Page Contacts is created from template Inner, where Contacts page content is inherit from Header/Footer and * Inner - the same as for Services. 

"**img**"

While creating pages, you can customise templates separately by adding necessary blocks to the placeholders.

Dashboard
---------

You can open the Dashboard by clicking the icon on the upper left of the page. 

"**img**"

The admin panel is very simplistic and from here you can manage Back-office Users [link to], Files[link to] or return to Pages[link to Page Management].
